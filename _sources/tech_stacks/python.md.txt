## Development Platforms

### Jupyter Lab/Notebook

Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab are open-source, web-based applications
developed under [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) for interactive
computing. These tools are widely used for data analysis and prototyping,
allowing users to execute and experiment with small sections of code
incrementally.

Jupyter Notebook offers a straightforward, linear interface ideal for simple
workflows, while JupyterLab provides a more versatile, multi-pane interface
designed as a complete workspace. Both tools enable the creation and editing of
Jupyter notebooks&mdash;interactive documents that seamlessly integrate code,
visualizations, and explanatory text.

JupyterLab can also be used as a desktop application via the
[JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop) project.
This is recommended as it makes creation and editing of Jupyter notebooks more
convenient.

Refer to the [Jupyter installation documentation](https://jupyter.org/install)
and the [JupyterLab Desktop](https://github.com/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-desktop)
project for installation details.
