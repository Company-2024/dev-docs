## Data Lake

A data lake is a centralized repository designed to store, process, and secure
large amounts of structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.

The core of the data lake is the storage component. Cloud storage is leading
because they offer scalability and high availability access at a very low cost
and with almost no time spent to procure.

## Data Orchestration

Data orchestration is an automated process for taking siloed data from one or
more storage locations, combining and organizing it, and making it available for
analysis.
